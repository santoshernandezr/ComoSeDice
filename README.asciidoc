== How to run the game?
You will want to clone the repo into your local computer or wherever you have all your GitHub projects.

=== Intellij
If you are on *IntelliJ* you can just run the `MenuGUI` java class.

=== Command line and Maven
If you want to run it through the command, you first have to make sure you have `maven` installed.

==== Windows
If you do not have maven installed you can download it on windows https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here].

==== Mac
If you are on a macbook and have brew installed, you can simply run `brew install maven`.

To confirm you have maven installed, go to the root directory of the project, and run the following commands `mvn clean install` and then run `mvn spring-boot:run`. This should start up the application and the GUIs.

Have fun :)!!
