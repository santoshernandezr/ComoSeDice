You will want to clone the repo into your local computer or wherever you have all your GitHub projects.

=== Intellij

If you are on *IntelliJ* you can just run the `MenuGUI` class. If you want to run it through the terminal, you first have to make sure you have `maven` installed. If you do not have maven installed you can download it on windows https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. If you are on a macbook and have brew installed, you can simply run `brew install maven`. with the following command you can go to the root directory of the project, run `mvn clean install` and then run `mvn spring-boot:run`.
